        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon of olive oil, plus extra for greasing
            </li>
            <li>300g strong bread flour, plus extra for dusting
            </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of instant yeast
            </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of salt

            </li>
            <li>ground beef, cheese, pepperoni, vegtables, ect. for the toppings of your pizza</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place your flour into a large bowl and add your yeast and salt. Then make a well in the centre, pour in 200ml of warm water and then add in your olive oil, slowly mix with a wooden spoon until you have a wet and soft dough.
            </li>
            <li>Remove your dough and tip onto a lightly floured surface, knead by hand for five minutes until smooth. Add more flour if your dough is too wet. Once smooth, pop your dough into a lightly greased bowl, cover the bowl with a tea towel or plastic wrap and leave to rise if you want a thicker crust (approx 1 hour), however, this is not essential if you prefer a thin crust pizza.
            </li>
            <li>If you’ve left your dough to rise, then knead it to knock it back and divide the dough into two balls. Dust your work surface with flour and roll out your dough using a rolling pin. Your dough will rise in the oven so make sure you roll it very thin. Once you’re happy with your pizza base pop it onto two lightly floured baking sheets.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 240C/fan 220C/gas 8.
            </li>
            <li>Add your chosen sauce and toppings to your pizza, we like a simple tomato sauce base, topped with mozzarella, a drizzle of garlic oil and a pinch of black pepper, but you can choose whatever your heart desires.
            </li>
            <li>Once ready pop your pizza, still on its baking sheet, onto a baking tray and bake in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes until crisp.
            </li>
            <li>Slice up, top with basil and enjoy.
            </li>

        </ol>
